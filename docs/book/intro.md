# Intro

CoffeeScript is a modern language that compiles to JavaScript. The syntax is inspired by Ruby and Python, and CoffeeScript has many features from those languages. The Book is designed to help you learn and explore CoffeeScript.

So, why is CoffeeScript better than writing pure JavaScript? Well for a start, JavaScript just looks a mess. CoffeeScript is pretty. The language uses Pythonic whitespace to delimit code, so you basicaly replace curly brackets and semicolons with indentation. It also has powerful features, such as comprehensions and classes, that allow you compose much cleaner code than you ever could in JavaScript. And JavaScript has a lot of *Bad Parts* that CoffeeScript hides from you.

Note that CoffeeScript is not a superset of JavaScript; the CoffeeScript compiler will choke on JavaScript code. That said, you can very naturally use JavaScript libraries *from* CoffeeScript, as CoffeeScript compiles to pure JavaScript.

> The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript".

The Book is derived, under an open license, from *The Little Book on CoffeeScript*.

*The Little Book on CoffeeScript* was authored by [Alex MacCaw][1] ([@maccman][2]), with contributions from [David Griffiths][3], [Satoshi Murakami][4] and [Jeremy Ashkenas][5]. MacCaw, with O'Reilly, has also published [a revised edition][6] of *The Little Book on CoffeeScript*.

This version, known only as the Book, is maintained as a component of CoffeeShop. If you have any input, please open a ticket on this project's [Issues Page][7].
