# Introduction

CoffeeScript's a modern, highly expressive language that compiles to JavaScript. It looks
like Ruby or Python, and CoffeeScript has many features from those languages, but it isn't
actually anything like those languages. At its heart, CoffeeScript is just JavaScript.

CoffeeScript doesn't try to replace JavaScript; it's more Zen than that. All the semantics,
the environments, the thriving JavaScript ecosystem, Douglas Crockford... That stuff's all
the same. The only difference is that you now have a beautiful language to program in.

It's not just that JavaScript syntax looks a bit of a mess though. CoffeeScript syntax is
specifically designed to elegantly express the JavaScript idioms that work, and those that
exist as time honoured workarounds for JavaScripts's many shortcomings. Features, such as
array comprehensions and classical classes, without the usual boilerplate and JavaScript's
archaic punctuation, just make it a lot easier to express yourself clearly with your code.
And then there's JavaScript's infamous *Bad Parts*; CoffeeScript just left that crap on the
side of the plate.
