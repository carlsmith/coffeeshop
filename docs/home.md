# Home Page

Welcome to **CoffeeShop**, a better [CoffeeScript][1] shell. It is still
pre-release, but is close to stable. This is a new version; early adopters
can still find the old version [here][2].

Note that the shell depends on Blink, so it will only work in Chromium based
browsers, such as [Google Chrome][3] and [Opera][4].

See [the Book](/docs/book/front.md) to get started.
