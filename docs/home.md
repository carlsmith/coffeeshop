# Home Page

Welcome to **CoffeeShop**, a better [CoffeeScript][1] shell.

The tracebacks depend on V8, so you need a Chromium based browser, like [Google
Chrome][2] or [Opera][3]. FireFox support should be possible soon.

Look through the [the Book](/docs/front.md) to get started with cosh. There's more
information about the project at [the Repo][4].
