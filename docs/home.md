Welcome to **CoffeeShop**, a better [CoffeeScript][1] shell.

Note that the shell depends on Blink, so it'll only work in Chromium based browsers, like
[Google Chrome][2] and [Opera][3], but you can publish scripts that'll work in any modern
browser.

See [the Book](/docs/book/front.md) to get started.
