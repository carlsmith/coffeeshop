# Home Page

Welcome to **CoffeeShop**, a better [CoffeeScript][1] shell.

Note that the shell depends on V8, so it'll only work in Chromium based browsers, like
[Google Chrome][2] and [Opera][3].

Look through the [the Book](/docs/book/front.md) to get started with cosh. There's more
information about the project at [the Repo][4].
