# CoffeeShop

CoffeeShop is a simple, but capable, CoffeeScript shell. It is designed to
be easy to use by people new to programming, but powerful too.

It has a familiar interface, a command line and text editor, but instead of
just outputting strings like a terminal would, it can potentially output
anything your browser can render.

CoffeeShop uses gists to let you share stuff. There are a few different ways
to share and use scripts, between users or as published scripts.

The goal is to develop a fun, interactive, programming environment that is
ideal for new programmers, while also being something that experienced
programmers use and contribute to.

This book is being developed as a guide for hackers to get up to speed on how
this shell works. Separate content will be created to learn programming from.
