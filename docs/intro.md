# CoffeeShop

CoffeeShop is a simple, but capable, CoffeeScript shell. It is designed to
be easy to use by people new to programming, but powerful too.

It has a familiar interface, a command line and text editor, but instead of
just outputting strings like a terminal would, it can potentially output
anything your browser can render.

CoffeeShop uses gists to let you share stuff. There are a few different ways
to share and use scripts, between users or as published scripts.

The goal is to develop an integrated, interactive programming environment
that is ideal for new programmers, while also being something that serious
hackers use and contribute to.
